					<p>This concise and difficult sentence is not well explained by any of the commentators. <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tsʽao Kung</span>, <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Li Chʽüan</span>, <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Mêng Shih</span>, <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tu Yu</span>, <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tu Mu</span>, and <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Mei Yao-chʽên</span> have notes to the effect that a general, though naturally stupid, may nevertheless conquer through sheer force of rapidity. <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ho Shih</span> says: “Haste may be stupid, but at any rate it saves expenditure of energy and treasure; protracted operations may be very clever, but they bring calamity in their train.” <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Wang Hsi</span> evades the difficulty by remarking: “Lengthy operations mean an army growing old, wealth being expended, an empty exchequer and distress among the people; true cleverness insures against the ocurrence of such calamities.” <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chang Yü</span> says: “So long as victory can be attained, stupid haste is preferable to clever dilatoriness.” Now <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Sun Tzǔ</span> says nothing whatever, except possibly by implication, about ill-considered haste being better than ingenious but lengthy operations. What he does say is something much more guarded, namely that, while speed may sometimes be injudicious, tardiness can never be anything but foolish⁠—if only because it means impoverishment to the nation. <abbr>Capt.</abbr> Calthrop indulges his imagination with the following: “Therefore it is acknowledged that war cannot be too short in duration. But though conducted with the utmost art, if long continuing, misfortunes do always appear.” It is hardly worth while to note the total disappearance of <span xml:lang="cmn-Hant">拙速</span> in this precious concoction. In considering the point raised here by <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Sun Tzǔ</span>, the classic example of Fabius Cunctator will inevitably occur to the mind. That general deliberately measured the endurance of Rome against that of Hannibal’s isolated army, because it seemed to him that the latter was more likely to suffer from a long campaign in a strange country. But it is quite a moot question whether his tactics would have proved successful in the long run. Their reversal, it is true, led to Cannae; but this only establishes a negative presumption in their favour. <a href="chapter-2.xhtml#noteref-203" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>The beginning of this sentence does not balance properly with the next, though obviously intended to do so. The arrangement, moreover, is so awkward that I cannot help suspecting some corruption in the text. It never seems to occur to Chinese commentators that an emendation may be necessary for the sense, and we get no help from them here. <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Sun Tzǔ</span> says that the cause of the people’s impoverishment is <span xml:lang="cmn-Hant">遠輸</span>; it is clear, therefore, that the words have reference to some system by which the husbandmen sent their contributions of corn to the army direct. But why should it fall on them to maintain an army in this way, except because the State or Government is too poor to do so? Assuming then that <span xml:lang="cmn-Hant">貧</span> ought to stand first in the sentence in order to balance <span xml:lang="cmn-Hant">近</span> (the fact that the two words rhyme is significant), and thus getting rid of <span xml:lang="cmn-Hant">國之</span>, we are still left with <span xml:lang="cmn-Hant">於師</span>, which latter word seems to me an obvious mistake for <span xml:lang="cmn-Hant">國</span>. “Poverty in the army” is an unlikely expression, especially as the general has just been warned not to encumber his army with a large quantity of supplies. If we suppose that <span xml:lang="cmn-Hant">師</span> somehow got written here instead of <span xml:lang="cmn-Hant">國</span> (a very simple supposition, as we have <span xml:lang="cmn-Hant">近於師</span> in the next sentence), and that later on somebody, scenting a mistake, prefixed the gloss <span xml:lang="cmn-Hant">國之</span> to <span xml:lang="cmn-Hant">貧</span>, without however erasing <span xml:lang="cmn-Hant">於師</span>, the whole muddle may be explained.

A comment of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tʽang</span> Emperor <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tʽai Tsung</span> goes to the root of the matter: ‘A <i xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">chʽi</i> manoeuvre may be <i xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">chêng</i>, if we make the enemy look upon it as <i xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">chêng</i>; then our real attack will be <i xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">chʽi</i>, and vice versa.

(It should be noted that the above is the correct pronunciation of <span xml:lang="cmn-Hant">閼與</span>, as given in the commentary on the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chʽien Han Shu</i>, <abbr>ch.</abbr> 34.

His Majesty then turned to <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chao Shê</span>, who fully admitted the hazardous nature of the march, but finally said: “We shall be like two rats fighting in a hole⁠—and the pluckier one will win!” so he left the capital with his army, but had only gone a distance of 30 <i xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">li</i> when he stopped and began throwing up intrenchments. For 28 days he continued strengthening his fortifications, and took care that spies should carry the intelligence to the enemy. The <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chʽin</span> general was overjoyed, and attributed his adversary’s tardiness to the fact that the beleaguered city was in the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Han</span> State, and thus not actually part of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chao</span> territory.

The reason why only five are given is that the subject is treated <i xml:lang="fr">en précis</i> (<span xml:lang="cmn-Hant">舉其大略也</span>). So in <abbr>chap.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XI</span>, where he discusses the variations of tactics corresponding to the Nine Grounds, <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Sun Tzǔ</span> mentions only six variations; there again we have an abridgment. [I cannot understand what <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chang Yü</span> means by this statement. He can only be referring to the four paragraphs starting at either <a href="chapter-11.xhtml#chapter-11-p-11">‘On dispersive ground⁠ ⁠…’</a> or <a href="chapter-11.xhtml#chapter-11-p-46">‘Therefore, on dispersive ground⁠ ⁠…’</a> in <abbr>chap.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XI</span>; but in both places all the nine grounds are discussed. Perhaps he is confusing these with the <a href="chapter-10.xhtml#chapter-10-p-1">Six <span xml:lang="cmn-Hant">地形</span></a>, (‘We may distinguish six kinds of terrain⁠ ⁠…’) of <abbr>chap.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">X</span>] All kinds of ground have corresponding military positions, and also a variation of tactics suitable to each (<span xml:lang="cmn-Hant">凡地有勢有變</span>). In <abbr>chap.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XI</span>, what we find enumerated first [starting at <a href="chapter-11.xhtml#chapter-11-p-2">‘Ground which can be freely traversed⁠ ⁠…’</a>] are the situations; afterwards [starting at <a href="chapter-11.xhtml#chapter-11-p-11">‘If the enemy has occupied⁠ ⁠…’</a>] the corresponding tactics. Now, how can we tell that the <span xml:lang="cmn-Hant">九變</span> ‘Nine Variations’ are simply the <span xml:lang="cmn-Hant">九地之變</span> ‘variations of tactics corresponding to the Nine Grounds’? It is said further on [<a href="chapter-8.xhtml#chapter-8-p-5">in chapter <span epub:type="z3998:roman">VIII</span></a>] that ‘the general who does not understand the nine variations of tactics may be well acquainted with the features of the country, yet he will not be able to turn his knowledge to practical account.’ Again, in <abbr>chap.</abbr> <span epub:type="z3998:roman">XI</span> [<a href="chapter-11.xhtml#chapter-11-p-41">here</a>] we read: ‘The different measures adapted to the nine varieties of ground (<span xml:lang="cmn-Hant">九地之變</span>) and the expediency of aggressive or defensive tactics must be carefully examined.’ From a consideration of these passages the meaning is made clear. When later on the nine grounds are enumerated, <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Sun Tzǔ</span> recurs to these nine variations. He wishes here to speak of the Five Advantages [see <a href="chapter-8.xhtml#chapter-8-p-6">infra</a>, ‘Ground which forms the key⁠ ⁠…’], so he begins by setting forth the Nine Variations. These are inseparably connected in practice, and therefore they are dealt with together.” The weak point of this argument is the suggestion that <span xml:lang="cmn-Hant">五事</span> “five things” can stand as a <span xml:lang="cmn-Hant">大畧</span>, that is, an abstract or abridgment, of nine, when those that are omitted are not less important than those that appear, and when one of the latter is not included amongst the nine at all. <a href="chapter-8.xhtml#noteref-406" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

We must rather look back to the five “variations” contained <a href="chapter-8.xhtml#chapter-8-p-3">above</a> (“There are roads⁠ ⁠…”). <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chia Lin</span> (who reads <span xml:lang="cmn-Hant">五變</span> here to balance the <span xml:lang="cmn-Hant">五利</span>) tells us that these imply five obvious and generally advantageous lines of action, namely: “if a certain road is short, it must be followed; if an army is isolated, it must be attacked; if a town is in a parlous condition, it must be besieged; if a position can be stormed, it must be attempted; and if consistent with military operations, the ruler’s commands must be obeyed.” But there are circumstances which sometimes forbid a general to use these advantages. For instance, “a certain road may be the shortest way for him, but if he knows that it abounds in natural obstacles, or that the enemy has laid an ambush on it, he will not follow that road. A hostile force may be open to attack, but if he knows that it is hard-pressed and likely to fight with desperation, he will refrain from striking,” and so on. Here the <span xml:lang="cmn-Hant">變</span> comes in to modify the <span xml:lang="cmn-Hant">利</span>, and hence we see the uselessness of knowing the one without the other⁠—of having an eye for weaknesses in the enemy’s armour without being clever enough to recast one’s plans on the spur of the moment. <abbr>Capt.</abbr> Calthrop offers this slovenly translation: “In the management of armies, if the art of the Nine Changes be understood [sic], a knowledge of the Five Advantages is of no avail.” <a href="chapter-8.xhtml#noteref-414" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>This need not be taken to mean that a sense of honour is really a defect in a general.

					<p>Here again, <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Sun Tzǔ</span> does not mean that the general is to be careless of the welfare of his troops. All he wishes to emphasise is the danger of sacrificing any important military advantage to the immediate comfort of his men. This is a shortsighted policy, because in the long run the troops will suffer more from the defeat, or, at best, the prolongation of the war, which will be the consequence. A mistaken feeling of pity will often induce a general to relieve a beleaguered city, or to reinforce a hard-pressed detachment, contrary to his military instincts. It is now generally admitted that our repeated efforts to relieve Ladysmith in the South African War were so many strategical blunders which defeated their own purpose. And in the end, relief came through the very man who started out with the distinct resolve no longer to subordinate the interests of the whole to sentiment in favour of a part. An old soldier of one of our generals who failed most conspicuously in this war, tried once, I remember, to defend him to me on the ground that he was always “so good to his men.” By this plea, but he but known it, he was only condemning him out of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Sun Tzǔ’s</span> mouth. <a href="chapter-8.xhtml#noteref-428" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

In <abbr>ch.</abbr> 82 of the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Shih Chi</i> we read: “<span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tʽien Tan</span> openly said: ‘My only fear is that the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Yen</span> army may cut off the noses of their <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chʽi</span> prisoners and place them in the front rank to fight against us; that would be the undoing of our city.’ The other side being informed of this speech, at once acted on the suggestion; but those within the city were enraged at seeing their fellow-countrymen thus mutilated, and fearing only lest they should fall into the enemy’s hands, were nerved to defend themselves more obstinately than ever. Once again <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tʽien Tan</span> sent back converted spies who reported these words to the enemy: ‘What I dread most is that the men of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Yen</span> may dig up the ancestral tombs outside the town, and by inflicting this indignity on our forefathers cause us to become fainthearted.’ Forthwith the besiegers dug up all the graves and burned the corpses lying in them. And the inhabitants of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chi-mo</span>, witnessing the outrage from the city-walls, wept passionately and were all impatient to go out and fight, their fury being increased tenfold. <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tʽien Tan</span> knew then that his soldiers were ready for any enterprise. But instead of a sword, he himself took a mattock in his hands, and ordered others to be distributed amongst his best warriors, while the ranks were filled up with their wives and concubines. He then served out all the remaining rations and bade his men eat their fill. The regular soldiers were told to keep out of sight, and the walls were manned with the old and weaker men and with women. This done, envoys were despatched to the enemy’s camp to arrange terms of surrender, whereupon the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Yen</span> army began shouting for joy. <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tʽien Tan</span> also collected 20,000 ounces of silver from the people, and got the wealthy citizens of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chi-mo</span> to send it to the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Yen</span> general with the prayer that, when the town capitulated, he would not allow their homes to be plundered or their women to be maltreated. <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chʽi Chieh</span>, in high good humour, granted their prayer; but his army now became increasingly slack and careless. Meanwhile, <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tʽien Tan</span> got together a thousand oxen, decked them with pieces of red silk, painted their bodies, dragon-like, with coloured stripes, and fastened sharp blades on their horns and well-greased rushes on their tails. When night came on, he lighted the ends of the rushes, and drove the oxen through a number of holes which he had pierced in the walls, backing them up with a force of 5000 picked warriors. The animals, maddened with pain, dashed furiously into the enemy’s camp where they caused the utmost confusion and dismay; for their tails acted as torches, showing up the hideous pattern on their bodies, and the weapons on their horns killed or wounded any with whom they came into contact. In the meantime, the band of 5000 had crept up with gags in their mouths, and now threw themselves on the enemy. At the same moment a frightful din arose in the city itself, all those that remained behind making as much noise as possible by banging drums and hammering on bronze vessels, until heaven and earth were convulsed by the uproar. Terror-stricken, the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Yen</span> army fled in disorder, hotly pursued by the men of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chʽi</span>, who succeeded in slaying their general <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chʽi Chieh</span>⁠ ⁠… The result of the battle was the ultimate recovery of some seventy cities which had belonged to the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chʽi</span> State.” <a href="chapter-9.xhtml#noteref-475" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

					<p>This is an obscure sentence, and none of the commentators succeed in squeezing very good sense out of it.

Fortunately we have <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chang Yü</span> to expound its meaning to us in language which is lucidity itself: <span xml:lang="cmn-Hant">兵力旣均又未見便雖未足剛進足以取人於廝養之中以并兵合力察敵而取勝不必假他兵以助己</span> “When the numbers are even, and no favourable opening presents itself, although we may not be strong enough to deliver a sustained attack, we can find additional recruits amongst our sutlers and camp-followers, and then, concentrating our forces and keeping a close watch on the enemy, contrive to snatch the victory.

Then, before there is time to range our soldiers in order of battle, the enemy in overwhelming strength suddenly appears on the scene. Advancing, we can nowhere take a breathing-space; retreating, we have no haven of refuge. We seek a pitched battle, but in vain; yet standing on the defensive, none of us has a moment’s respite. If we simply maintain our ground, whole days and months will crawl by; the moment we make a move, we have to sustain the enemy’s attacks on front and rear. The country is wild, destitute of water and plants; the army is lacking in the necessaries of life, the horses are jaded and the men worn-out, all the resources of strength and skill unavailing, the pass so narrow that single man defending it can check the onset of ten thousand; all means of offence in the hands of the enemy, all points of vantage already forfeited by ourselves:⁠—in this terrible plight, even though we had the most valiant soldiers and the keenest of weapons, how could they be employed with the slightest effect?” Students of Greek history may be reminded of the awful close to the Sicilian expedition, and the agony of the Athenians under Nicias and Demosthenes.

The <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Wei</span> general <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ssǔ-ma I</span> was then military governor of <span xml:lang="cmn-Hant">宛</span> <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Wan</span>, and getting wind of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Mêng Ta’s</span> treachery, he at once set off with an army to anticipate his revolt, having previously cajoled him by a specious message of friendly import. <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ssǔ-ma’s</span> officers came to him and said: “If <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Mêng Ta</span> has leagued himself with <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Wu</span> and <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Shu</span>, the matter should be thoroughly investigated before we make a move.” <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ssǔ-ma I</span> replied: “<span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Mêng Ta</span> is an unprincipled man, and we ought to go and punish him at once, while he is still wavering and before he has thrown off the mask.” Then, by a series of forced marches, he brought his army under the walls of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Hsin-chʽêng</span> within the space of eight days. Now <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Mêng Ta</span> had previously said in a letter to <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chu-ko Liang</span>: “<span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Wan</span> is 1200 <i xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">li</i> from here.

Besides, <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ssǔ-ma I</span> is sure not to come himself, and the generals that will be sent against us are not worth troubling about.” The next letter, however, was filled with consternation: “Though only eight days have passed since I threw off my allegiance, an army is already at the city-gates. What miraculous rapidity is this!” A fortnight later, <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Hsin-chʽêng</span> had fallen and <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Mêng Ta</span> had lost his head.

Now is the time to strike, before <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Hsiao Hsien</span> even knows that we have got an army together.

The best plan, then, is for us to separate and disperse, each in a different direction. The King of Khotan will march away by the easterly route, and I will then return myself towards the west. Let us wait until the evening drum has sounded and then start.’ <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Pan Chʽao</span> now secretly released the prisoners whom he had taken alive, and the King of Kutcha was thus informed of his plans. Much elated by the news, the latter set off at once at the head of 10,000 horsemen to bar <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Pan Chʽao’s</span> retreat in the west, while the King of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Wên-su</span> rode eastwards with 8000 horse in order to intercept the King of Khotan. As soon as <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Pan Chʽao</span> knew that the two chieftains had gone, he called his divisions together, got them well in hand, and at cockcrow hurled them against the army of Yarkand, as it lay encamped. The barbarians, panic-stricken, fled in confusion, and were closely pursued by <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Pan Chʽao</span>. Over 5000 heads were brought back as trophies, besides immense spoils in the shape of horses and cattle and valuables of every description. Yarkand then capitulating, Kutcha and the other kingdoms drew off their respective forces. From that time forward, <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Pan Chʽao’s</span> prestige completely overawed the countries of the west.” In this case, we see that the Chinese general not only kept his own officers in ignorance of his real plans, but actually took the bold step of dividing his army in order to deceive the enemy. <a href="chapter-11.xhtml#noteref-629" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>

This must signify that envoys have come from the Northern barbarians, and that consequently he is in a state of indecision, not knowing with which side to throw in his lot. That surely is the reason. The truly wise man, we are told, can perceive things before they have come to pass; how much more, then, those that are already manifest!’ Thereupon he called one of the natives who had been assigned to his service, and set a trap for him, saying: ‘Where are those envoys from the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Hsiung-nu</span> who arrived some days ago?’ The man was so taken aback that between surprise and fear he presently blurted out the whole truth. <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Pan Chʽao</span>, keeping his informant carefully under lock and key, then summoned a general gathering of his officers, thirty-six in all, and began drinking with them. When the wine had mounted into their heads a little, he tried to rouse their spirit still further by addressing them thus: ‘Gentlemen, here we are in the heart of an isolated region, anxious to achieve riches and honour by some great exploit. Now it happens that an ambassador from the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Hsiung-nu</span> arrived in the kingdom only a few days ago, and the result is that the respectful courtesy extended towards us by our royal host has disappeared. Should this envoy prevail upon him to seize our party and hand us over to the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Hsiung-nu</span>, our bones will become food for the wolves of the desert.

					<p>Compare the paradoxical saying <span xml:lang="cmn-Hant">亡者存之基死者生之本</span>. These words of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Sun Tzǔ</span> were once quoted by <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Han Hsin</span> in explanation of the tactics he employed in one of his most brilliant battles, already alluded to in <a href="#note-258">note 258</a>. In 204 <abbr class="era">BC</abbr>, he was sent against the army of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chao</span>, and halted ten miles from the mouth of the <span xml:lang="cmn-Hant">井陘</span> <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ching-hsing</span> pass, where the enemy had mustered in full force. Here, at midnight, he detached a body of 2000 light cavalry, every man of which was furnished with a red flag. Their instructions were to make their way through narrow defiles and keep a secret watch on the enemy. “When the men of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chao</span> see me in full flight,” <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Han Hsin</span> said, “they will abandon their fortifications and give chase. This must be the sign for you to rush in, pluck down the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chao</span> standards and set up the red banners of <span xml:lang="cmn-Hant">漢</span> <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Han</span> in their stead.” Turning then to his other officers, he remarked: “Our adversary holds a strong position, and is not likely to come out and attack us until he sees the standard and drums of the commander-in-chief, for fear I should turn back and escape through the mountains.” So saying, he first of all sent out a division consisting of 10,000 men, and ordered them to form in line of battle with their backs to the River <span xml:lang="cmn-Hant">泜</span> <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ti</span>. Seeing this manoeuvre, the whole army of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chao</span> broke into loud laughter. By this time it was broad daylight, and <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Han Hsin</span>, displaying the generalissimo’s flag, marched out of the pass with drums beating, and was immediately engaged by the enemy. A great battle followed, lasting for some time; until at length <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Han Hsin</span> and his colleague <span xml:lang="cmn-Hant">張耳</span> <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chang Ni</span>, leaving drums and banner on the field, fled to the division on the river bank, where another fierce battle was raging. The enemy rushed out to pursue them and to secure the trophies, thus denuding their ramparts of men; but the two generals succeeded in joining the other army, which was fighting with the utmost desperation. The time had now come for the 2000 horsemen to play their part. As soon as they saw the men of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chao</span> following up their advantage, they galloped behind the deserted walls, tore up the enemy’s flags and replaced them by those of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Han</span>. When the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chao</span> army turned back from the pursuit, the sight of these red flags struck them with terror. Convinced that the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Hans</span> had got in and overpowered their king, they broke up in wild disorder, every effort of their leader to stay the panic being in vain. Then the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Han</span> army fell on them from both sides and completed the rout, killing a great number and capturing the rest, amongst whom was King <span xml:lang="cmn-Hant">歇</span> <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Ya</span> himself⁠ ⁠… After the battle, some of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Han Hsin’s</span> officers came to him and said: “In the <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book">Art of War</i> we are told to have a hill or tumulus on the right rear, and a river or marsh on the left front.

					<p><abbr>Capt.</abbr> Calthrop hardly attempts to translate this difficult paragraph, but invents the following instead: “Discover what he most values, and plan to seize it.” <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Chʽên Hao’s</span> explanation, however, is clear enough: <span xml:lang="cmn-Hant">我若先奪使地而敵不至雖有其利亦奚用之是以欲取其愛惜之處必先微與敵人相期誤之使必至</span> “If I manage to seize a favourable position, but the enemy does not appear on the scene, the advantage thus obtained cannot be turned to any practical account. He who intends, therefore, to occupy a position of importance to the enemy, must begin by making an artful appointment, so to speak, with his antagonist, and cajole him into going there as well.” <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Mei Yao-chʽên</span> explains that this “artful appointment” is to be made through the medium of the enemy’s own spies, who will carry back just the amount of information that we choose to give them.

In consultation with his officers, he exclaimed: “ ‘Never venture, never win!<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-790" id="noteref-790" epub:type="noteref">790</a> The only course open to us now is to make an assault by fire on the barbarians under cover of night, when they will not be able to discern our numbers.

The Intendant is only a humdrum civilian, who on hearing of our project will certainly be afraid, and everything will be brought to light. An inglorious death is no worthy fate for valiant warriors.’ All then agreed to do as he wished. Accordingly, as soon as night came on, he and his little band quickly made their way to the barbarian camp. A strong gale was blowing at the time. <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Pan Chʽao</span> ordered ten of the party to take drums and hide behind the enemy’s barracks, it being arranged that when they saw flames shoot up, they should begin drumming and yelling with all their might. The rest of his men, armed with bows and crossbows, he posted in ambuscade at the gate of the camp. He then set fire to the place from the windward side, whereupon a deafening noise of drums and shouting arose on the front and rear of the <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Hsiung-nu</span>, who rushed out pell-mell in frantic disorder. <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Pan Chʽao</span> slew three of them with his own hand, while his companions cut off the heads of the envoy and thirty of his suite.

In spite of <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tu Mu’s</span> note, <span xml:lang="cmn-Hant">焚其行伍因亂而擊之</span>, I must regard “company burning” (<abbr>Capt.</abbr> Calthrop’s rendering) as nonsense pure and simple.

					<p>This is one of the most perplexing passages in <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Sun Tzǔ</span>. The difficulty lies mainly in <span xml:lang="cmn-Hant">不修其功</span>, of which two interpretations appear possible. Most of the commentators understand <span xml:lang="cmn-Hant">修</span> in the sense (not known to <i epub:type="se:name.publication.book" xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Kʽang Hsi</i>) of <span xml:lang="cmn-Hant">賞</span> “reward” or <span xml:lang="cmn-Hant">舉</span> “promote,” and <span xml:lang="cmn-Hant">其功</span> as referring to the merit of officers and men. Thus <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tsʽao Kung</span> says: <span xml:lang="cmn-Hant">善不踰日</span> “Rewards for good service should not be deferred a single day.” And <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tu Mu</span>: “If you do not take opportunity to advance and reward the deserving, your subordinates will not carry out your commands, and disaster will ensue.” <span xml:lang="cmn-Hant">費留</span> would then probably mean <span xml:lang="cmn-Hant">留滯費耗</span> “stoppage of expenditure.” For several reasons, however, and in spite of the formidable array of scholars on the other side, I prefer the interpretation suggested by <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Mei Yao-chʽên</span> alone, whose words I will quote: <span xml:lang="cmn-Hant">欲戰必勝攻必取者在因時乘使能作為功也作為功者修火攻水攻之類不可坐守其利也坐守其利者凶也</span> “Those who want to make sure of succeeding in their battles and assaults must seize the favourable moments when they come and not shrink on occasion from heroic measures: that is to say, they must resort to such means of attack as fire, water and the like. What they must not do, and what will prove fatal, is to sit still and simply hold on to the advantages they have got.” This retains the more usual meaning of <span xml:lang="cmn-Hant">修</span>, and also brings out a clear connection of thought with the previous part of the chapter. With regard to <span xml:lang="cmn-Hant">費留</span>, <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Wang Hsi</span> paraphrases it as <span xml:lang="cmn-Hant">費財老師耗</span> “expending treasure and tiring out [<abbr>lit.</abbr>, ageing] the army.” <span xml:lang="cmn-Hant">費</span> of course is expenditure or waste in general, either of time, money or strength. But the soldier is less concerned with the saving of money than of time. For the metaphor expressed in “stagnation” I am indebted to <span xml:lang="zh-Latn-wadegile">Tsʽao Kung</span>, who says: <span xml:lang="cmn-Hant">若水之留不復還也</span>. <abbr>Capt.</abbr> Calthrop gives a rendering which bears but little relation to the Chinese text: “unless victory or possession be obtained, the enemy quickly recovers, and misfortunes arise.

Why then should carriage and transportation cause exhaustion on the highways?⁠—The answer is, that not victuals alone, but all sorts of munitions of war have to be conveyed to the army. Besides, the injunction to ‘forage on the enemy’ only means that when an army is deeply engaged in hostile territory, scarcity of food must be provided against. Hence, without being solely dependent on the enemy for corn, we must forage in order that there may be an uninterrupted flow of supplies.

He begins by adverting to the frightful misery and vast expenditure of blood and treasure which war always brings in its train. Now, unless you are kept informed of the enemy’s condition, and are ready to strike at the right moment, a war may drag on for years. The only way to get this information is to employ spies, and it is impossible to obtain trustworthy spies unless they are properly paid for their services. But it is surely false economy to grudge a comparatively trifling amount for this purpose, when every day that the war lasts eats up an incalculably greater sum.

When it was dark, they dismounted a few hundred feet away from the enemy’s camp and stealthily crept up to listen, until they succeeded in catching the passwords used by the army. Then they got on their horses again and boldly passed through the camp under the guise of night-watchmen (<span xml:lang="cmn-Hant">警夜者</span>); and more than once, happening to come across a soldier who was committing some breach of discipline, they actually stopped to give the culprit a sound cudgelling! Thus they managed to return with the fullest possible information about the enemy’s dispositions, and received warm commendation from the Emperor, who in consequence of their report was able to inflict a severe defeat on his adversary.” With the above classification it is interesting to compare the remarks of Frederick the Great:<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-793" id="noteref-793" epub:type="noteref">793</a> “<i xml:lang="de">Es giebt vielerley Sorten von Spions: 1.

When they propose anything very material, secure their persons, or have in your possession their wives and children as hostages for their fidelity. Never communicate anything to them but what it is absolutely necessary that they should know.”<a href="endnotes.xhtml#note-794" id="noteref-794" epub:type="noteref">794</a> <a href="chapter-13.xhtml#noteref-748" epub:type="backlink">↩</a></p>
